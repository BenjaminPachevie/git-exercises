## Specs
- In this exercise, no need to run rake start since you will clone an existing repo. 

- You are working on a project with a coworker. 
- You need to clone the existing github repository, make a branch and push it. 

- Clone the repository for these exercises: git@github.com:agosha-wra/git-exercises.git andn go in the created folder. 
- Checkout to a new branch called 'my-feature'
- Create a file in the lib folder, feel free to write a nice comment :)
- Push your branch to the remote repository and make a pull request on GitHub

## How to test
- Just run the 'rake' command, when everything is green, you can go to the next exercise :)
- Made a mess ? just delete your folder and start again

## What is important here 
- Understanding the point of a remote and how it works.
- Git clone.
- Git push and the difference with a PR.
