## Specs
- Implement a new git repo with git init and make a commit with all the files in the folder
- Make a new branch from master called feature-1, create a new file in that branch and commit 
- Make a new branch from feature-1 called feature-1a, create a new file in that branch and commit
- Make a new branch from master called feature-2, create a new file in that branch and commit 
- Make a new branch from feature-2 called feature-2a, create a new file in that branch and commit
- Checkout to feature-1a and make a new branch called feature-1b, create a new file in that branch and commit

## How to test
- Just run the 'rake' command, when everything is green, you can go to the next exercise :)
- Made a mess ? just run 'rake start_again' and start again from init 

## What is important here 
- Notice how branches 1 and 2 are completely different commits with no knowledge of each other ? 
- Notice how branching out of master is different than branching out of another branch / commit ?
