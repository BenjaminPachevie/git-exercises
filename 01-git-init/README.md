## Specs
- Create a new git repo with git init
- Checkout to a new branch called 'my-feature' from master
- Add all files and commit one time in branch 'my-feature'

## How to test
- Just run the 'rake' command, when everything is green, you can go to the next exercise :)
- Made a mess ? Start again with 'rake start_again'
