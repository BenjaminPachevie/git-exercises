## Specs
- Implement a new git repo with git init
- Make a new branch called 'my-feature' from master
- Add all files and commit one time

## How to test
- Just run the 'rake' command, when everything is green, you can go to the next exercise :)
- Made a mess ? Delete the repo git deleting the .git folder and start again : 'rm -rf .git'
