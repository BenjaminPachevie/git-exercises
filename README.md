# git-exercises

Exercises for practicing git commands and understand git repos.  
Needs: Ruby, Rspec, Ruby-Git. 

I made these exercises for people wanting to better understand Git commands.  
Each folder has an exercise with a readme explaining the rules and a set of tests.  
Get all green tests = you have completed the exercise, kudos ! 

On all exercises you can run :  
rake ---> runs the test suite  
rake start_again --> resets the exercise 


On some exercises you HAVE TO run before you do anything :  
rake start ---> sets up the exercise  

How to use:   
Clone this repo - git clone   
Delete the .git folder for more clarity - rm -rf .git  
Go into the first folder - cd 01-git-init
