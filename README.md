# git-exercises

Exercises for practicing git commands and understand git repos.  

# How to install

- Do not clone this repo, just download the files as a zip and copy them somewhere. 
- Install required gems: 
```
gem install rspec ruby-git
```

# Who are these made for

I made these exercises for beginners wanting to better understand Git commands, and having a nice playground to try things since git can be daunting at first. 

 - Each folder has an exercise with a readme explaining the rules and a set of tests.  
 - Get all green tests = you have completed the exercise, kudos ! 

# On all exercises you can run this to check if you have the solution
```
rake
````  
# On most exercises - follow the guidelines! - you can run

```
rake start
```
- To start again

```
