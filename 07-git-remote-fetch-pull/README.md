## Specs
- Before the exercise, run 'rake start'

- You are working on a project with a coworker. 
- You are both working on features and sharing your work through a remote, called 'origin' in your repo.

- Your coworker has pushed new features to the remote and you want them to work on your machine: 
    + Create a new local branch called feature-2, from master, and pull the branch called feature-2 in the remote
    + Create a new local branch called feature-1, from master, and pull the branch called feature-1 in the remote

- You have a new feature ready for review, time to push it: 
    + Create a new local branch called feature-4, from master, create a file, commit it and push it to the remote's feature-4 branch. 

## How to test
- Just run the 'rake' command, when everything is green, you can go to the next exercise :)
- Made a mess ? just 'rake start_again'

## What is important here 
- Understanding the point of a remote and how it works.
- Git pull and what it does
- Git push and what it does
